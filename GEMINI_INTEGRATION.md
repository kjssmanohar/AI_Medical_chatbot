- Pattern matching symptom analysis
- Basic keyword detection
- Static responses from JSON database

### **After (Gemini AI + Fallback)**
- 🧠 **Advanced AI Understanding**: Natural language processing with Gemini
- 🩺 **Contextual Medical Responses**: AI-powered symptom analysis
- 🚨 **Smart Emergency Detection**: Enhanced safety protocols
- 🔄 **Seamless Fallback**: Automatic switch to rule-based if AI fails
- 📊 **Response Tracking**: Shows which system powered each response

## 🔑 To Enable Gemini AI

### Step 1: Get Gemini API Key
1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key

### Step 2: Configure API Key
```bash
# Edit the .env file
nano /workspaces/AI_Medical_chatbot/.env

# Replace this line:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# With your actual key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyA...your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
cd /workspaces/AI_Medical_chatbot/backend
pkill -f python  # Stop current server
python integrated_app.py  # Start with Gemini enabled
```

## 🧪 Testing Both Systems

### Test Fallback System (Current):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I have fever and headache"}'
# Response will show: "powered_by": "Rule-based Symptom Analysis"
```

### Test Gemini AI (After API key setup):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I feel anxious and have trouble sleeping"}'
# Response will show: "powered_by": "Google Gemini AI"
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

1. **Emergency Detection**: Both systems detect medical emergencies
2. **Fallback Protection**: Never fails completely
3. **Medical Disclaimers**: All responses include professional consultation advice
4. **Helpline Integration**: Emergency contacts always available

## 📊 Response Types

| System | Response Format | Features |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Gemini AI** | `ai_analysis` | Natural language, contextual understanding |
| **Rule-based** | `symptom_analysis` | Structured, reliable, fast |
| **Emergency** | `emergency` | Immediate safety protocols |
| **Mental Health** | `mental_health` | Specialized support resources |

## 🔍 Monitoring

Check which system is active:
```bash
tail -f /workspaces/AI_Medical_chatbot/backend/server.log
```

Look for:
- ✅ `"Gemini AI model initialized successfully"` - AI enabled
- ⚠️ `"Gemini API key not found, using rule-based system only"` - Fallback mode
